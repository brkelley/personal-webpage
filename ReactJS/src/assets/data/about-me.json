  "biography": "I was born in Riverside, California, but moved to Raleigh, North Carolina when I was 2 years old. I lived & worked in Raleigh for 26 years, until March 2022 when I moved to NYC. I went to high school at Enloe High School and graduated from North Carolina State University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2016. Since 6th grade, I have loved music. I've played trumpet, trombone, baritone, french horn, and tuba until I finally discovered drums & percussion. I played in my high school's drumline and in NC State's drumline. In my spare time, I go to concerts, play video games, and convince my friends to go on NYC adventures.",
  "originStory": "I started college intending to major in a chemistry field. However, after struggling through Chemical Engineering, Paper Science & Engineering, and Geology, I realized that Chemistry just isn't the field for me. My sister graduated NC State with a Computer Science degree and she recommended that I try a Computer Science class. I was hesitant at first (living in sibling's shadow is difficult), but I eventually cracked and took Introduction to Computer Science. I fell in love immediately. I found out what specialty I wanted when I had my PointSource internship. I loved coding in AngularJS and I knew then that I wanted to do front-end development.",
